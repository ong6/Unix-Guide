### Vim Articles

- [Time to Drop Emacs and Vi?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/61738/time-to-drop-emacs-and-vi)
  on StackOverflow. "_Programmers are notorious for using the tools that helps
  them get the job done in the most efficient way possible. These editors are
  ancient yet still being used because they are good, solid editors, proven by
  time. If they get the job done and get the job done well, why should we drop
  them in favor of something else?_"

- [What are the benefits of learning Vim?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/597077/what-are-the-benefits-of-learning-vim)
  on Stack Overflow. "_Usually vim's killer features are considered: A) that
  it's available on pretty much every Unix you'll ever encounter and B) your
  fingers very rarely have to leave the home row, which means you'll be able to
  edit text very, very quickly. It's also usually very fast and lightweight even
  when editing huge files._"

- [Learn `vim` Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)
  "_I suggest you teach yourself Vim in 4 steps: 1. Survive. 2. Feel
  comfortable. 3. Feel Better, Stronger, Faster. 4. Use superpowers of vim_"

- [Where Vim Came From](https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html)
  -- from TwoBitHistory. "_Perhaps more importantly, while we’re asking
  questions, why does exiting Vim involve typing :wq? Sure, it’s a “write”
  operation followed by a “quit” operation, but that is not a particularly
  intuitive convention. Who decided that copying text should instead be called
  “yanking”? Why is :%s/foo/bar/gc short for “find and replace”? Vim’s
  idiosyncrasies seem too arbitrary to have been made up, but then where did
  they come from?"_

- [Vim's Big Idea](https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1) -
  by Mike Kozlowski. _"This philosophy of minimalist commands that can be
  composed together is the fundamental originating philosophy of Unix, and Vim
  exemplifies it like no other editor."_

- [VIM Pays Excellent Dividends](https://dispatches.artifexdeus.com/vim-pays-excellent-dividends-814241804984) -
  by John Bjorn Nelson. _"Being conservative, let’s say it makes you 5% more
  productive. More specifically — once your brain maps the keystrokes to muscle
  memory — it makes you 5% faster at completing the mundane tasks…the ones which
  dominate programming. That added productivity snowballs. It’s an extra twenty
  minutes a day to build or explore (or learn), that used to go to
  copy/paste-like operations."_

- [The Powers of VIM](http://dudarev.com/blog/powers-of-vim/) - by Artem Dudarev

- [The 11 Steps to Learning Vim](https://github.com/damassi/learn-vim/blob/master/README.md) -
  by [damassi](https://github.com/damassi). _"Regardless of the initial
  confusion and difficulty in getting started, you're making your future
  developer self immensely more productive by diving in and taking the plunge.
  Seriously. I'm just a few weeks in right now and I can positively say that
  learning Vim has been the best work-related decision of my life. It's fun, and
  in the strangest of ways it makes you think better."_

- [Vim for People Who Think Things like Vim and Weird and Hard](https://csswizardry.com/2014/06/vim-for-people-who-think-things-like-vim-are-weird-and-hard/) -
  by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/). _"the fact that, yes, people
  still use an editor that is over 20 years old (in turn based on a tool from
  the 70s), and those people number in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps they
  might be onto something."_

- [Why I use Vim](https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/why-i-use-vim/) - Pascal
  Precht. "_once I was able to do some basic operations in Vim and actually
  started working again, I made almost as twice as much progress at work in
  about half the time. I know that sounds kind of crazy but I’m serious. And
  that convinced me that I made the right choice.<br><br> So, do yourself a
  favor and climb that mountain. Just remember that you can slide down
  afterwards._"
